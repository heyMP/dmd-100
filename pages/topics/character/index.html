<h1>Character</h1>
<p>In fictional film or literature, character types are used to help viewers to empathize with the story. A person's character typically refers to the qualities they possess. However, a character can also be an animal, object, or abstraction in a story. Objects are often represented through anthropomorphism, where human attributes are applied to a non-human. According to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf0WjeE6eyM">explainer video about animated light</a> for the movie, Akira, the city itself was considered to be a character. Other examples of non-human characters include Lightning McQueen from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/">Cars (2006)</a> and a homicidal car tire named Robert in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1612774/">Rubber (2010)</a>.</p>
<h2>Characterization</h2>
<p>In the process of characterization, a writer will construct traits of a character according to how they will serve the story's plot requirements. Characters are often inspired by people from real life, but often become simplified, combined, and adapted as needed.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationTropes">tvtropes.org wiki</a> for an expansive collection of characterization tropes.</p>
<h2>Types (tropes) in fictional stories</h2>
<p>Character types are often one or a combination of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Main character:</strong> We experience the story through this character's eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting character:</strong> These characters help us understand the main character, advance the story.</li>
<li><strong>Protagonist character:</strong> The story typically follows this character most closely. They are needed to resolve the conflict and typically have heroic qualities.</li>
<li><strong>Antagonist character:</strong> Tries to prevent the story goal. Opposes the protagonist.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic character:</strong> Shows development and change over time.</li>
<li><strong>Static character:</strong> Does not develop or change over time.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-hero character:</strong> Protagonist who lacks heroic qualities.</li>
<li><strong>Round character:</strong> Well developed, complex, sometimes contradictory traits.</li>
<li><strong>Flat character:</strong> Not well developed, static.</li>
<li><strong>Stock character:</strong> Archetypal, stereotypical, and flat.</li>
<li><strong>Foil character:</strong> Typically contrasts the main character in qualities and values so that we may learn more about the main character.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolic character:</strong> This character represents an abstract concept like &quot;hope&quot; or &quot;justice.&quot;</li>
