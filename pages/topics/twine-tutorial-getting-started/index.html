<h1>Twine tutorial: Getting started with Twine</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, you will be guided through the steps to create a simple hypertext Twine story.</p>
<h2>Creating linked passages</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://twinery.org/">https://twinery.org/</a>.</li>
<li>Click on <a href="https://twinery.org/2/">Use it online</a>.</li>
<li>Add a new story and give it a name.
<ul>
<li>If you've done this correctly, a blue grid will appear with an example passage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Double click on <em><strong>Untitled Passage</strong></em> to go into edit mode.</li>
<li>Rename <em><strong>Untitled Passage</strong></em> to <em><strong>Start</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Type the following text into the body: <code>I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out: [[&quot;Who's there?&quot;]]</code></li>
<li>Press escape or click the x to close edit mode.
<ul>
<li>You will see that a new passage has been created automatically called <em><strong>&quot;Who's there?&quot;</strong></em></li>
<li>The untitled passage should now be named <em><strong>Start</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Double click on <em><strong>&quot;Who's there?&quot;</strong></em> to go into edit mode.</li>
<li>Type the following text into the body: <code>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. [[Go Back|Start]]</code></li>
<li>Press escape or click the x to close edit mode.</li>
<li>Press the Play button to test the story.</li>

<ol>
<li>Write out the main plot points of the story on paper or a text editor.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://twinery.org">Twinery.org's editor</a>, create a new passage for each major plot point horizontally across the screen.</li>
<li>Move the passages vertically up and down to create a visualization for rising and falling action. If you run out of space on the screen, you can decrease the size of the grid by choosing one of the other grid/block icons on the bottom menu bar.<br>
<media-image source="twinery-btns.png" alt="twine grid buttons"></media-image></li>
<li>Edit each passage and write in the passage details and links.</li>
<li>Read through your story to see if the plot points match the intended rising and falling action. Make adjustments accordingly.</li>
