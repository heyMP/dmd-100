<h1>Designing Time</h1>
<p>Designing Time (p.166 - 177 ) in Design and Truth by Robert Grudin</p>
<h2>Writing prompt</h2>
<p>In these chapters, Grudin discusses the dimensionality of temporal design from examples of storytelling, music, sports, rhetoric, and marketing. He also speaks about contrast being the differentiator between designing one's time and managing one's time. Grudin again reflects on his &quot;intentional&quot; day and what it actually means to be intentional. Do you agree with assessment that modern institutions have all but done away with satisfying needs that cannot be bought and sold? Think about what inspires, energizes, or brings you delight. What are those things? Suppose you are working in a design studio (you can choose which kind). You are the new hire and are asked to propose to your boss how they might incorporate some activity into the workplace that fulfills the need for delight, inspiration, or energy. What would you propose?</p>
