<h1>Develop: MVP Prototype</h1>
<p>You will now start prototyping with your materials to try to approximate the toy from your product pitch. You will develop an MVP or <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> to use in later user testing.</p>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ol>
<li>You must not spend more than $10.00 USD to assemble the kit.</li>
<li>Your users must be able to assemble their kits without special skills or tools. Tools are excluded from the cost restriction.
<ol>
<li>Allowed tools: Scissors, X-Acto knife</li>
<li>Allowed surface marking implements: Pen, pencil, marker, paintbrush</li>
