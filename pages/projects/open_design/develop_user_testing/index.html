<h1>Develop: User testing</h1>
<p>Ideally, you will want to get feedback from a user representative of your audience both in terms of who will be constructing with the kit and who will be the end user. For instance, a parent might be the one to put the kit together if the toy is intended for a small child. Alternatively, a child might be assembling the kit for themselves or as a gift for another.</p>
<h2>Test session</h2>
<p>Carefully observe someone attempting to use the kit. Take notes of what you notice. You may need to give some verbal suggestions if your users get stuck, but try to say as little as possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Print or send your instructions from the prototyping phase.</li>
<li>Have a target user try to follow the instructions to build the kit from scratch. That is, do not just have someone interact with the objects that you built, but have the target user actually build the kit itself. If the toy is aimed at young children, the target user might be a parent or older sibling. This can be a friend, family member, or colleague. Ideally, you will be in the room with the participant while they follow your prototype instructions. However, if your participant is remotely located, ask them to set up their webcam or phone camera so that you can see them and their work space. It is best to be available in real time because your user may get stuck. Recording a video is not required, but if you intend to record them, be sure to ask for their permission or their parents permission if it's a child.</li>
<li>Write observational notes as they go through the process, and any insights that you discover. It may be helpful to ask your participant to talk through their thought process as they are putting things together. Help your user through any parts of the process that they get stuck on, and make a note of it.</li>
<li>Keep track of how long it takes your participant to follow your instructions.</li>
<li>After your user finished, ask them some followup questions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What did you like about using the kit?</li>
<li>What didn't you like? Why is that?</li>
<li>What could be better?</li>
<li>What were you feeling while following the instructions?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Post work to the Studio</h2>
<p>Use the indicated file format. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>After you are done testing, submit a typed <code>.doc</code> of your test notes. Be sure to include your name on the document.</li>
</ol>
