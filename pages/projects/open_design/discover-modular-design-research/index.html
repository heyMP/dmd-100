<h1>Discover: Modular design research</h1>
<p>This assignment asks you to look at objects not as whole &quot;things,&quot; but rather as a sum of parts. It also asks you to consider the user experience of the person involved with building a &quot;thing.&quot; To do this, explore and explain some aspects <strong>modular design</strong> by investigating why products and objects are designed and constructed the way they are. Areas of investigation could include architecture, engineering, product and furniture (industrial) design, and others.</p>
<p>Find images of interesting or inspiring ways of making, attaching, and combining parts. You will create a presentation of your findings to help others understand how modular systems work.</p>
