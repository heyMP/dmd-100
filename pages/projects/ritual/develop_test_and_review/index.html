<h1>Develop: Test and review</h1>
<p>Now that your prototype is done, it is time to participate in feedback. You will be assigned a few prototypes to review. Your prototype will also be reviewed by your classmates. This is an opportunity to practice receiving and interpreting feedback. A critique of your work might be stressful at first, but it is one of the most common, and useful processes in design.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Provide feedback</strong> to your assigned prototypes based on the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>Are you able to clearly understand the relationship between the app and the ritual? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Does the app seem integral to the ritual? Why?</li>
<li>What affordances does that app provide for a typical user.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Read the feedback you have been given.</strong> To plan a course of action, you can categorize what was said in four categories: compliment, advice, criticism, and suggestion. Based on which category the feedback lands, you can analyze how to make decisions to improve your work.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Post work to the Studio</h2>
<p>Use the file format indicated in each step. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements. Please check that your work has uploaded properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Post the corresponding feedback to your assigned feedback group member's assignment submission as a <strong>comment</strong> in Studio.</li>
<li>Combine all the feedback you've written and upload to this assignment's submission text field or upload a MS Word document.</li>
</ol>
