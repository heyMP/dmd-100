<h1>Deliver: Hypertext narrative (draft 2)</h1>
<p>Iterative improvement is the key to good design. Now that you have peer feedback, tweak, change, and improve your work. Re-read your story and identify where you might be able to further develop characters, increase tension and drama, introduce dialogue, alter story pacing, smooth out awkward transitions, etc.</p>
<p>In this draft, consider the role of style and emerging techniques in your narrative. See examples <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_narrative_techniques.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the following questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there are strong organizational structure to your story?</li>
<li>Do the characters have motivations, challenges, and arcs?</li>
<li>Is the technology or change you're inventing described in convincing detail?</li>
<li>Is the story too long? Too short? Does every sentence matter?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Review your feedback for the hypertext narrative.
<ol>
<li>If you are unsure about how feedback works, please see these <a href="/toolkit/feedback-and-critique.md">guidelines</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Reflect on how your work can be improved. Analyze, interpret, and apply relevant feedback to improve the project.</li>
<li>Record the changes that you made to the hypertext narrative.</li>
<li>Publish the HTML file.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Optional CSS Styling</h2>
<p>As you finalize your story, you may use this time to customize the appearance of your Twine pages using CSS—the declarative programming language used in web development.</p>
<p>This is an optional step, but it's a great skill to learn if you're interested in web design and a fun way to personalize your story's look.</p>
