<h1>Discover: Word-pairs</h1>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pen or pencil</li>
<li>Journal</li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Please allow at least 60-75 minutes to complete this activity.</p>
<ol>
<li>In your journal, write three objects from your home. If you cannot think of any, choose three objects from a random object generator. Here is <a href="http://roger.redevised.com/">one</a>.</li>
<li>Free association writing. (10 mins)
<ul>
<li>On a journal page, write as many words about each object as you can.</li>
<li>When you are done, circle any <strong>three</strong> words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose <strong>one</strong> focus word from the list below. Write the adjectives circled from the previous step in front of your chosen focus word, creating three word-pairs (I.E. - if you choose education, you would combine your adjectives with only education):
<ul>
<li>education</li>
<li>economy</li>
<li>health</li>
<li>wellness</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>technology</li>
<li>government</li>
<li>freedom</li>
<li>justice</li>
<li>democracy</li>
<li>business</li>
<li>trade</li>
<li>environment</li>
<li>food</li>
<li>agriculture</li>
<li>ecosystem</li>
<li>energy</li>
<li>labor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now that you have created three word-pairs, write each one onto a separate journal page.
<ul>
<li><strong>Think about important contemporary issues. Now imagine 30 years into the future and an ideal or positive situation has occurred</strong>, inspired by the word-pair (IE - if it's 2020, think forward to 2050). Think of one-sentence descriptions to explain the scenario. It is okay to take inspiration for your ideas from current events, film, books, news, personal experiences, etc. Write as many responses per word-pairs as you can (at minimum, two per word-pair). Limit yourself to 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
