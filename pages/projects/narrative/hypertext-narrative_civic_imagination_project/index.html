<p><media-image source="assets/1500.jpg" alt="Photo of clouds and an airplane contrail"></media-image></p>
<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>For this project, you will create a fictional hypertext fiction with an open-source application called Twine focused on building a better future world, set in the year 2047. The main goal of this project is to create <strong>plausible</strong>, civic-minded design patterns for improving the future. A hypertext fiction is a fictional story that is read by progressing through a series of story nodes containing hypertext links, with each link leading to another node in the story. You will follow a design process that will help you generate ideas, create characters and plot, incorporate feedback, and iterate towards a final work.</p>
