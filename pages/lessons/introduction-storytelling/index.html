<h1>Storytelling</h1>
<p>We are surrounded by stories. These stories affect our attitudes, beliefs, and form our entire perception of reality. Historically, stories are how humans have transferred knowledge from generation to generation. Everything a designer does will be in support of telling stories and by extension, shape the world we inhabit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storytelling has a long history as a mechanism of knowledge transfer and can be considered a rapid immersion in an experience: One cannot experience time travel, but one can gain knowledge about the act of time travel through a rich compelling, and highly experiential story.</p>
<p>â€“ Jon Kolko</p>

<h2>Lesson Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of this lesson is not to teach you every facet and application of storytelling. Mastering this subject, as with most subjects, will take quite a long time. Instead, you will learn about common elements of storytelling, structural models, and methods for building stories that you can apply as a framework for most of what you create and communicate as a designer.</p>
